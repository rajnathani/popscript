Chapter 1: Core
====================

Now we will list almost everything [the remaining is in the advanced section] in the most API way. This will include:

    - :ref:`components`
    - :ref:`pop-class`
    - :ref:`pop-properties`
    - :ref:`popscript-few-functions`
    - :ref:`popscript-flags`


Before we begin: Namespace
----------------------------

| PopScript comes with its library functions, helper functions, and global/local data structures of all sorts. Inevitably, there exists names in the namespace which PopScript holds exclusively. Best efforts have been made to strike a balance between developer's productivity with a convenient API & minimal usage of the namespace.
| Here is a list of the names used.
| Global objects:

    - popscript
    - popscript_flags
    - PopScript
    - PS (alias of the above: PopScript)

| Global constructors/functions:

    - Pop
    - pop
    - popOut
    - popClose
    - popHide
    - popToggle
    - initiatePopScript

| As long as you leave this part of the namespace as it is, things should be alright. Note that a few of the objects and functions mentioned above are purely helper functions for within PopScript, and not meant for usage.


.. _components:

Components of a Pop
---------------------
.. image:: ../static/imgs/page.png

The above contains the 3 components of a pop: cover, box, cross. (cross content is not considered to be a primary component)

.. _pop-class:

Pop Class
--------------
As mentioned in `pop class section of Getting Started </docs/getting_started.html#second-point-pop-class>`_ pop classes are very similar to CSS classes, to reiterate:

    1. **Properties**: Both pop classes and CSS classes have a property-value system. Though pop goes a level deeper, and provides scope nested properties, for example 'CSS_CLASSES', 'ANIMATIONS' > 'IN'/'OUT', and 'POSITION' scopes mentioned in the above code. However, the fundamental of property-value still remains a similarity.


    2. **Inheritance:** 2 or more CSS classes can be separated by spaces to form a chain of CSS classes which inherit from each other from the left to the right, in this format '<class 1> <class 2> <class 3> ... <class n>'. This exact same holds for classes in PopScript. For example here, 'basic' and 'success' can be merged together as 'basic success'. And just as CSS class provide no explicit limit to the number of classes inheritable, pop classes offer the same too. Later on we will also see how similarly to inline CSS, we can also add inline PopScript :)

Syntax rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A pop class can only contain alphanumerics and underscores, in terms of regex `[A-Za-z_]``


.. _basic-class:

The omnipresent pop class: "basic"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    *Now here is an important point: The class 'basic' would, (1) generally provide the skeleton of the pops you would like to create on your site, and/or (2) probably the very same class (just 'basic') you would use on multiple occasions just as it is. Therefore, PopScript prepends 'basic' to every single pop class you provide. Which means that if you input in pop class 'success', you are actually (behind the scenes) constructing a pop of class 'basic success'. And if you give no pop class: '', then that would simple evaluate to 'basic'. Keep this part in mind before you begin poppin*


.. _pop-properties:

Pop Properties
----------------
As mentioned in the previous subsection, pop classes are designed to replicate CSS classes in many ways. One of them is the notion of property-value. Now, to help you refer to pop properties, let us list below the entire default popscript (given at the top of the file `popscript.js`)::

    var popscript = {
        basic: {
            STYLE: {
                CLASS: {
                    box: 'simple-box',
                    cover: 'curtain',
                    cross: 'cross'
                }

Before commencing on the properties, let us note the meaning of a PopScript boolean:


.. _popscript-boolean:

PopScript Boolean (poolean)
---------------------------------
In most programming languages (including JavaScript) booleans are specified by the keywords ``true`` and ``false``, and in the language of objective C, the keywords ``YES`` and ``NO`` are used. Now given that PopScript is a HTML5 library, and is implemented in JavaScript, the obvious choice of keywords would be the native ones ``true`` and ``false``. These 2 keywords have been chosen, however it was decided to extend these keywords. Its done with PopScript booleans which are (obviously) either ``true`` or ``false``:

    - true
        - Mentioned with JavaScript boolean ``true``
        - Mentioned with any String beginning with a "y" (case insensitive). Eg: ``"yup"``, ``"YESS"``, ``"yEaH buddy!"```

    - false
        - Mentioned with JavaScript boolean ``false``
        - Mentioned with any String beginning with a "n" (case insensitive). Eg: ``"NOOO"``, ``"no way!"``, ``"No, I said no"``

:docs-ps-scope:`POSITION {`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. _position-x:

:docs-ps-prop:`x:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    String/Number
 Task     Accepts the horizontal positioning for the pop's box. Broadly there are 3 types of inputs: (1) **basic**: only a numeric value is accepted, such as "400" (String) or 400 (Number), in this case (of "400"/400) the box will be positioned 400 pixels from the left of the page. If provided a number prefixed with "!" then the position will be respected from the right of the page, in the case of "!400", the box will be positioned 400 pixels from the right of the page. (2) **percent**: a percent value is accepted, such as "20%", in this case the box will be positioned 20% from the left of the page. Similar to the previous *basic* positioning, if a number prefixed with a "!" then the position will be respected from the right of the screen, in the case of "!20%", the box will be positioned 20% from the right of the page. (3) **macro**: a predefined value is accepted which can be any of the 3 -> "auto", "left", or "right". "auto" positions the box at the center of the screen, "left" positions the box to the left most of the screen (equivalent to 0 or "0" or "0%"), "right" positions the box to the right most of the screen (equivalent to "!0" or "!0%"). **+scrolled** or **+scroll** can be added to any of the aforementioned values, this will include the current amount of horizontal scroll to the given position. For instance if the value of "400 +scrolled" is given, and the user has scrolled 150 pixels to the right, creating a pop will be positioned at `400 +150` = 550 pixels from the left of the page. The difference between "+scrolled" and "+scroll" is that "+scrolled" is applied on a one-time basis, whereas "+scroll" is applied forever as it updates with further scrolling. In the current example of "400+scrolled", if the user further scrolls 30 pixels to the right, with an overall scroll of (150+30) 180 pixels, the "400+scrolled" will strictly evaluate to the initial call where the scrolled amount was 150 pixels and therefore evaluates to 550 again, whereas "400+scroll" will respect the new scroll position of 180 pixels and evaluate to 580 pixels.
 Example  400 / "400" / "!400" / "20%" / "!20%" / "auto" / "left" / "right" / "40 +scrolled" / "40 +scroll"
 Default "auto"
======== ==================================================


.. _position-y:

:docs-ps-prop:`y:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    String/Number
 Task     Accepts the vertical positioning for the pop's box. Broadly there are 3 types of inputs: (1) **basic**: only a numeric value is accepted, such as "400" (String) or 400 (Number), in this case (of "400"/400) the box will be positioned 400 pixels from the top of the page. If provided a number prefixed with "!" then the position will be respected from the bottom of the page, in the case of "!400", the box will be positioned 400 pixels from the bottom of the page. (2) **percent**: a percent value is accepted, such as "20%", in this case the box will be positioned 20% from the top of the page. Similar to the previous *basic* positioning, if a number prefixed with a "!" then the position will be respected from the bottom of the screen, in the case of "!20%", the box will be positioned 20% from the bottom of the page. (3) **macro**: a predefined value is accepted which can be any of the 3 -> "auto", "top", or "bottom". "auto" positions the box at the center of the screen, "top" positions the box to the top most of the screen (equivalent to 0 or "0" or "0%"), "bottom" positions the box to the bottom most of the screen (equivalent to "!0" or "!0%"). **+scrolled** or **+scroll** can be added to any of the aforementioned values, this will include the current amount of horizontal scroll to the given position. For instance if the value of "400 +scrolled" is given, and the user has scrolled 150 pixels to the bottom, creating a pop will be positioned at `400 +150` = 550 pixels from the top of the page. The difference between "+scrolled" and "+scroll" is that "+scrolled" is applied on a one-time basis, whereas "+scroll" is applied forever as it updates with further scrolling. In the current example of "400+scrolled", if the user further scrolls 30 pixels to the bottom, with an overall scroll of (150+30) 180 pixels, the "400+scrolled" will strictly evaluate to the initial call where the scrolled amount was 150 pixels and therefore evaluates to 550 again, whereas "400+scroll" will respect the new scroll position of 180 pixels and evaluate to 580 pixels.
 Example  400 / "400" / "-400" / "20%" / "-20%" / "auto" / "top" / "bottom" / "40 +scrolled" / "40 +scroll"
 Default "auto"
======== ==================================================


.. _position-z:

:docs-ps-prop:`z:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    String/Number
 Task     Accepts the absolute/relative z-index for pop's box and (optionally) cover. **absolute**: only a numeric value is accepted, such as "999" (String) or 999 (Number), in this case both the pop's box and cover will obtain a z-index of ``999``. **relative**: a numeric value prepended with a unary operator is accepted here (regex: \\s*(\\+|\\-)\\s*(\\d*)), example "+2" or "-5". In the former case of "+2", the z-index will evaluate to 2 greater than the base z-index :ref:`z` (mentioned in :ref:`popscript-flags`). In the latter case of "-5", the z-index will evaluate to 5 lesser than the base z-index Z. This *relative* positioning has beneficial use cases in the event of multiple (fixed/absolute) elements being overlaid on the page, which includes other pops; however in any other case it can just easily be left out.
 Example  "999" / 999 / "+2" / "-5"
 Default  Base z-index :ref:`z` (in :ref:`popscript-flags`)`
======== ==================================================


.. _position-fixed:

:docs-ps-prop:`fixed:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Accepts the choice of keeping the pop's box fixed on the page. This is similar to CSS position fixed, and by default is turned on. However note that if `roller <#roller>`_ is set to true, then this property is ignored.

.. _position-roller:

:docs-ps-prop:`roller:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Accepts the choice of having a background fixed scrolling effect. You might be highly perplexed by the last sentence! Well its hard to explain in words. Check out the last example named 'roller' the `demo </v1/demo.html>`_ page of this website. To see another example of such an implementation, check out the pop up Trello uses when you hit the "?" keystroke on `a Trello board <https://trello.com/b/nC8QJJoZ/trello-development>`_. Note: please don't let the name 'roller' confuse you here, its cause can be rooted to unimaginative issues of its creator.
 Default  false

.. _position-x-scrolled:

:docs-ps-prop:`x_scrolled:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Setting this property to true is equivalent to specifying "+scrolled" for the :ref:`position-x`. Its recommended that you specify it through :ref:`position-x`.
 Default  false
======== ==================================================


.. _position-y-scrolled:

:docs-ps-prop:`y_scrolled:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Setting this property to true is equivalent to specifying "+scrolled" for the :ref:`position-y`. Its recommended that you specify it through :ref:`position-y`.
 Default  false

.. _position-x-scroll:

:docs-ps-prop:`x_scroll:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`

 Default  false
======== ==================================================


.. _position-y-scroll:

:docs-ps-prop:`y_scroll:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Setting this property to true is equivalent to specifying "+scroll" for the :ref:`position-y`. Its recommended that you specify it through :ref:`position-y`.
 Default  false
======== ==================================================


.. _position-check:

:docs-ps-prop:`check:`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

======== ==================================================
 Input    String
 Task     Accepts the timeout and interval checking of the pop's alignment. This is by far, the most complicated and advanced property you would deal with, leaving it to its default value is highly suggested, however for optimization reasons we provide you the ability to set it. Explanation: When a user scrolls on a page OR resizes the page, PopScript *already has* event handlers to deal with any position/alignment changes in real time. However, in the case of the box of your pop, abruptly changes its size due to: (1) An image included within the box loaded finally, blossoming to its true size (2) The developer dynamically modifies the DOM within the box. Due to lack of DOM4's MutationObserver support, the only way to detect these size changes would involve polling every few seconds/milliseconds. This could be achieved with a simple `setInterval(function(){//Check the alignment of every box and cover here}, 1)` however performing a routine like that can be extremely resource intensive, and can potentially impact runtime performance. **Explanation of this property**: Given a string of syntax "<number1>, <number2>*, <number3>, <number4>, ... <numberN>(asterisk optional)", this merely represents a list, with items of 2 types: (1) *asterisk suffixed*: For instance in the example given, <number2> is followed by an asterisk "*", this signifies that every <number2> milliseconds a check on the position alignment of the given pop will be performed (the base: setInterval), (2) *non-asterisk suffixed*: The remaining numbers in the example are not followed by an immediate asterisk "*", which translates to that after <number1>, <number3>, and <number4> milliseconds from the entry of the pop on the page, a check on the position alignment of the given pop will be performed. The current default value is "20, 333, 1000*"; which means that 20 ms and 333 ms after the pop has entered alignment checks will be performed, and every 1000 ms (1 second) an alignment check will be performed. As we warned you, this property is especially complicated.
 Example  "100", "200*", "150, 800*"
 Default  "20, 333, 1000*"
======== ==================================================


.. _out:

:docs-ps-prop:`out:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    String ("close" | "hide")
 Task     Accepts the type of exit desired on the pop being exited by the user. There exist multiple possible ways of the user exiting a pop as you have seen so far: it could be that the user pressed the cross button, or hit the 'esc' key, or click on the cover overlay area behind the pop. Whichever it may be, broadly the pop has 2 possible destinies: (1) "close": where its destroyed permanently from the DOM (2) "hide": where its completely hidden from the display, however it exists in the DOM and can be re-popped (using the function :ref:`pop-show`). Therefore you have 2, and only 2 options here: "hide" or "close".
 Example  "close" / "hide"
 Default  "close"
======== ==================================================


.. _click-me-out:

:docs-ps-prop:`click_me_out:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`

 Task     Accepts the choice of enabling the user to click anywhere on the (box of) pop to drag it around. Once the pop is dragged, its mentioned properties of :ref:`position-x` and :ref:`position-y` are overridden. (By default the cursor changes to a ``cursor:move`` value while the pop is dragged, if this is desired to be changed then edit the 3 lines CSS code specific to ``.popscript-drag`` at the top of the ``popscript.css`` file)
 Default  false
======== ==================================================


.. _esc:

:docs-ps-prop:`esc:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================

.. _cover:

:docs-ps-prop:`cover:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`
 Task     Accepts the choice of enabling a cover behind the box of the pop. The cover is essentially the (translucent/opaque) overlay behind the box of the pop.
 Default  true
======== ==================================================



.. _cross:

:docs-ps-prop:`cross:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    :ref:`popscript-boolean`

.. _cross-content:

:docs-ps-prop:`cross_content:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    String

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    Number
 Task     Accepts the number of milliseconds after which to out the pop.
 Example  300
 Default  disabled
======== ==================================================



.. _runtime-properties:

:docs-ps-runtime:`< Runtime Properties Below: >`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| All properties below this line are runtime properties, which basically means that the input for these pop properties depend on the pop being created.
| Note that these properties are function based:



.. _before-pop-in:

:docs-ps-prop:`beforePopIn:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    Function
 Task     Accepts a function to be called just before the pop is about to be created. If the return value of this callback function evaluates to false, the pop will not be created or redisplayed after being hidden. The function has one parameter: <new> (new is set to true when the pop has not been created before, and false when the pop is being redisplayed after being hidden).
======== ==================================================



.. _before-pop-out:

:docs-ps-prop:`beforePopOut:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    Function
 Task     Accepts a function to be called when the user attempts to out (closed/hidden depending on the :ref:`out` property) the pop. If the return value of this callback function evaluates to false, the pop will not be closed/hidden. This can be used to confirm with the user that they would like to close/hide the pop with "are you sure?" type messages. The function is provided with the parameters: <box node> , <out_type (this is based on the :ref:`out`  property)>
======== ==================================================



.. _after-pop-out:

:docs-ps-prop:`afterPopOut:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    Function / Array
 Task     Accepts a function or an array of functions, to be called after the pop has been outted (closed/hidden depending on the :ref:`out`  property). The function is provided with the parameters: <:ref:`pop-id`> , <out_type (this is based on the :ref:`out` property)>
======== ==================================================


.. _near-element:

:docs-ps-prop:`nearElement:`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======== ==================================================
 Input    Array: [Node, Function]
 Task     Accepts an array containing a DOM Node as the 1st element, and callback function as the 2nd element. The pop is positioned on the return value of the function provided, where the return value must be an array, the 1st element being the popscript ``x`` position and the second element being the popscript ``y`` position (this popscript position co-ordinates shall always be given priority over any previously mentioned popscript position co-ordinates). Now you may ask: Why did I provide a DOM node as the first element of this property? The answer lies in the function callback; the function has 4 parameters: <x (px) position of Node> , <y (px) position of Node> , <width (px) position of Node> , <height (px) position of Node>
 Example  Check the "dropdown" example on the demo page

.. _popscript-few-functions:

Few Functions
-----------------------
Interpreting the function declarations require knowledge of the documentation technique explained `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17132014/documenting-for-optional-parameters-in-javascript>`_.

.. _pop:

pop()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``pop( [ binder, ] content [, pop_class ] [, inline_popscript ] )``
| (The return value is the pop's :ref:`pop-id`)
| ``pop()`` is a multipurpose function and is broadly categorized as to having 2 behaviours depending on whether ``binder`` is specified or not:


.. _without-binder:

Without binder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| *(Sub) Declaration:* ``pop( content [, pop_class ] [, inline_popscript ])``
| Here is an explanation of each of the 3 parameters:

parameter: content
+++++++++++++++++++

| Type: **String** / **Node** / **Function**
| The ``content`` parameter contains the inner content of the box (see :ref:`components`)
| It can be of 3 types:

| (1) **String**: This will simply be accepted as the inner HTML of the box.

Example::

        pop( "Hello <b>World</b>" );


| (2) **Node**: This will be accepted as the immediate child node of the box.

Example::

        var info = document.createElement('div');
        var header = document.createElement('h3');
        header.innerText = "Your Account Balance";
        var result = document.createElement('p');
        result.innerText = "500 $";

        info.appendChild(header);
        info.appendChild(result);

        pop( info );


| (3) **Function**: The return value of the function will be accepted as either a (1) **String** or (2) **Node**. (You will notice that this isn't very different from directly providing a string or a node, however the use of this will become more apparent with binders)
| The two main advantages of using functions is (1) Available within a function is a new (local) context for separation of namespace and aesthetics of your code; (2) The :ref:`pop-id` is available as the first argument of the function callback.

Example::

    pop (
        function (pop_id) {
            var info = document.createElement('div');
            var header = document.createElement('h3');
            header.innerText = "Your Account Balance";
            var result = document.createElement('p');
            result.innerText = "500 $";

            info.appendChild(header);
            info.appendChild(result);

            return info;
        }
    );


.. _parameter-pop-class:

parameter: pop_class
+++++++++++++++++++++
| Type: **String**
| Optional: Yes
| Default: ""
|
| The input here is the pop class for the given pop class which you want your pop to contain. Details of a pop class is given here: :ref:`pop-class`. Remember that the the 'basic' class is always preprended (:ref:`basic-class`). Which means that an input of "success" evaluates to "basic success". And if this parameter ``pop_class`` is not provided the default will be "", which evaluates to "basic".


Example::

    pop( "Your transaction was successful!", "success");



.. _parameter-inline-popscript:

parameter: inline_popscript
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| Type: **Object**
| Optional: Yes
| Default: {}
|
| The input here is popscript. Inline popscript provides a way to specify pop specific popscript properties without having to declare a separate pop class altogether.


Example::

    pop( "You will be unable to close this pop by using the 'esc' key.", {esc: "no"} );

.. _with-binder:

With binder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| *(Sub) Declaration:* ``pop( binder, content [, pop_class ] [, inline_popscript ] )``
| The binder parameter is peculiar, in the sense that it causes the ``pop()`` function to behave not as a function call, but instead a function handler.

parameter: binder
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| Type: **Array** of < **Node**, **Array** / **String** [, **Array** / **String**] >
| The input here is an Array which either contains 2 items or 3 items. Here is a breakdown of the elements:

    - **Node**: This is a DOM Node. Example: ``document.getElementById('dropdown-button')``.
    - **Array** / **String**: This is either, an Array of Strings *or* a single String. The String(s) here are events. Example: ``["click", "mouseover"]`` / ``"focus"``. (These events are **in events**)
    - **Array** / **String**: This is either, an Array of Strings *or* a single String. The String(s) here are events. Example: ``["click", "mouseout"]`` / ``"blur"``. (These events are **out events**) [optional parameter]

| In essence, the role which binder plays follows these sequences of steps:

    1. Bind all the **in events** (2nd parameter) to the Node (1st parameter).
    2. On the firing of any of the above attached events, deploy the pop with remaining parameters as to be done :ref:`without-binder`.
    3. If **out events** has been specified, attach all the **out events** to the Node; which on firing will cause pop to be outted.
    4. Attach all the **in events** to the Node; which on firing will cause the pop to be outted.

| A state diagram showing the process of popping with a binder:

.. image:: ../static/imgs/binder.png

| Note that specifying an event in both **in events** and **out events** is a hack which will provide the ability to toggle the pop's existence.

Example (taken from the `demo </v1/demo.html>`_  page)::


    var dropdown_button = document.getElementById('demo-dropdown');
    pop([dropdown_button, 'click', 'click'],
        '<ul><li>About</li><li>Help</li><li>Log Out</li></ul>', 'dropdown',
        { nearElement: [dropdown_button, function (x, y, w, h) {
            return [x, y + h + 4]
        }]}
    );



.. _pop-out:

popOut()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``popOut( [, pop_id ] [, out ] )``
| ``popOut()`` accepts  2 parameters, both of which are optional:

parameter: pop ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Type: :ref:`pop-id`
| Optional: Yes
| Default: Highest :ref:`pop-id`
|
| The :ref:`pop-id` provided will be the targeted pop.
| If no pop ID is provided, then the most recent most (highest one on the stack), ie. the pop with the highest pop ID will be the targeted pop.

.. _parameter_out:

parameter: out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Type: **String**
| Optional: Yes
| Default: property :ref:`out`
|
| The out type provided is in compliance with the pop property :ref:`out`. Which implies that if "hide" is provided, then the pop will be hidden from the page, and if "close" is provided the pop will be removed from the DOM.
| If no out type is provided, then the out type will be based on the pop's compiled popscript which depends upon :ref:`parameter-pop-class` and :ref:`parameter-inline-popscript`.


.. _pop-close:

popClose()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``popClose( [, pop_id ]``
|
| ``popClose( <parameter> )`` is the equivalent of calling :ref:`pop-out` with :ref:`out` specified as "close":
| ``pop( <parameter> , "close")``



.. _pop-hide:

popHide()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``popHide( [, pop_id ]``
|
| ``popHide( <parameter> )`` is the equivalent of calling :ref:`pop-out` with with :ref:`out` specified as "hide":
| ``pop( <parameter> , "hide")``



.. _pop-show:

popShow()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``popShow( pop_id )``

parameter: pop ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Displays the pop with the given pop ID, if its in the hidden state.
| Else nothing is done.


.. _pop-toggle:

popToggle()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| *Declaration:* ``popShow( pop_id )``

parameter: pop ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Displays the pop with the given pop ID, if its in the hidden state.
| Else hides the pop.



.. _popscript-flags:

PopScript Flags
-------------------

| These flags provide basic information about the setup of PopScript.


The location is at top of the file, below the popscript::

    var popscript_flags = {
        'alert error on error': false,  // alerts the error (alert)
        'throw error on error': true,   // throws the error (throw)
        'Z': 1000                       // base z-index for all pops
    };


.. _z:

Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| This is the base ``z-index`` for pops created.
| Providing relative positions to this base z-index, or bypassing this base z-index is all done in the pop property :ref:`z`.


alert error on error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| This is a (javascript) boolean representing the choice of alerting with ``alert()`` due to a popscript errors caused by malformed syntax or directives.

throw error on error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| This is a (javascript) boolean representing the choice of throwing with ``throw`` due to a popscript errors caused by malformed syntax or directives.
